# Apply Gist to Page

A Chrome Extension for applying the contents of a Github Gist to the page from the Omnibox.

It's kind of like a bookmarklet but a little more fancy pants.

Only files in the gist with language set to JavaScript or CSS will be applied to the page.  If you have any ideas for supporting additional languages, let me know!

## How to Use:

1. Type "Gist" into the Omnibox then hit tab or space.
1. Enter the Gist number you wish to apply.
