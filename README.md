Apply Gist to Page
==================

A Chrome Extension for applying the contents of a Github Gist to the page from the Omnibox.

It's kind of like a bookmarklet but a little more fancy pants.

How to Use:
-----------

1. Type "Gist" into the Omnibox then hit tab or space.
2. Enter the Gist number you wish to apply.
